        <h2>Pasta Description</h2>
        <p>
            Fresh pasta takes less time to cook than dried pasta, so keep a close eye on it â€” it should take between two
            and five minutes.
        </p>
        <h2>Pasta Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups flour</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                Mix flour, eggs, olive oil, and salt in a bowl until combined. Add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, to flour
                mixture until a smooth, thick dough forms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 10 minutes. Let dough rest for 5 to 10
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Divide dough into 8 balls; use a pasta machine to roll and cut dough into desired pasta shape.</li>
        </ol>
